Making sure your visitors **understand what they need to do** on your website to get what they came for. That sounds logical. Unfortunately that is not always the case for a lot of digital products that exist today. Of course UX designers play a huge part in this, but I do feel it's **my duty as a front-end developer** as well to keep a broad view of the elements in a project and how they behave. "We already have something that does something similar. Maybe we could use that, instead of adding a new, slightly different, thing?"
