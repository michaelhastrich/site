title: Inclusiveness
---

I believe it's essential that whoever visits a website or uses an app to do something, is able **to do what they came to do**. Regardless of their abilities. In practice what that means, is that I try to make my work as accessible as possible. Whether someone uses a keyboard to navigate the website or uses assistive technology like a screenreader, my goal is to make the experience **as seamless as possible for as many people as possible**. I ensure that by writing clean and semantic markup, keeping an eye on document structure, sticking with native components as much as possible and working closely with designers to come up with **solutions that work for everyone**.
