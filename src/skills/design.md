I have had the pleasure of working with **a lot of different designers** over the years. I speak their "language" and get why **details like line-height and white space are important**. I understand that sometimes an extra variant of a header is necessary to make a component stand out a bit extra. I love to **sit down with designers** to discover systems within their ideas and shape those **ideas into a design system** that we can use in (almost) every context and use-case.
