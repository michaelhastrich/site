title: Maintainability

I like simple solutions that **make sense to people**. That means I like to keep my tool chain within a project **as lean as possible**. Do we really need Bootstrap or Tailwinds? Why do we write a bunch of mixins that are used only once or twice and nobody understands anymore 2 months down the road? And if we decide we actually do need them, let's **document them** as best as we can, so the next developer or our future-selfs at least have an understanding of what the problem was we were solving. **Removing 'the magic'** from a code base gives me great pleasure.
