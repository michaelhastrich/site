I am passionate about the accessible web, semantic markup and cascading style sheets. On this website I’ll share some of the projects I’ve worked on and some of my thoughts about earlier mentioned passions. If you want to get in touch, just drop me a line on [hi@michaelhastrich.nl](mailto:hi@michaelhastrich.nl).
