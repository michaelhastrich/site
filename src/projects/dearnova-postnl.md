At DearNova I worked on the team responsible for the personal account section of the website as well as the new Track and Trace application for PostNL. Both applications use the latest version of Angular (8 at the time of writing) for their front-end. My main responsibility was building a design system, working closely with UX and visual designers, that allowed quick implementation of new features whilst safeguarding accessibility and PostNL's brand.
