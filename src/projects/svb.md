At the SVB I helped maintain and extend the internal knowledgebase, that is used daily by the Service Team employees who determine if someone is eligble for social security benefits. In the Scrum team I was responsible for maintaining the CSS and HTML. I also worked closely with the backend developers to maintain the CMS and make sure the service, dating back to 2004, remained stable and performant.
