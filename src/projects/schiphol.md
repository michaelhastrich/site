For Royal Schiphol Group I worked in one of the four Scrum teams responsible for [schiphol.nl](https://www.schiphol.nl), the website for the national airport. As one of the front-end developers responsible for Personal Relevant Information I worked on the online maps and "My Travel Day" parts of the website.
A large part of my time at Schiphol I spend on building the new Component Library that was part of a complete redesign of the website at the beginning of 2018.
