Bynco sells high quality used cars and does so completely online. They have no showrooms or sales representatives, so the online sales experience needs to be trustwhorthy and solid. DearNova previously built and designed the business-to-consumer part of the site and in 2020 I joined the team that would build a consumer-to-consumer section. My main responsibilities were the front-end development (Angular) of several new features for buyers and sellers, to allow for a secure and smooth transition between the vehicle's owners.
