[ONVZ](https://www.onvz.nl) is a health insurance company in the Netherlands. For Fabrique Amsterdam I was part of the Scrum team responsible for creation of their redesigned website that focuses heavily on user convenience. Part of the website was build using Vue.js and together with the front-end developer of Fabrique I build a component library that enables ONVZ to extend their website over the next couple of years.
