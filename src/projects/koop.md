KOOP ([overheid.nl](https://www.overheid.nl)) is the organisation responsible for Dutch governmental publications and announcements. They maintain and manage a range of websites. To assure a consistent style across these different sites, a component library was created that could be used to build and extend the different websites and maintain a similar look-and-feel across all the different domains.
